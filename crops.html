    <p1 class="fonts"><b>P</b>addy, also called rice paddy, small, level, flooded field used to cultivate rice in southern and eastern Asia.
        Wet-rice cultivation is the most prevalent method of farming in the Far East
        where it utilizes a small fraction of the total land yet feeds the majority of the rural population. 
        Rice was domesticated as early as 3500 BC, and by about 2,000 years ago it was grown in almost 
        all of the present-day cultivation areas,predominantly deltas, floodplains and coastal plains, and some terraced valley slopes.</p1> </br>

    <h3>Climate and Soil requirement of Paddy Crop Cultivations</h3>
      <p2 class="fonts">Rice is a crop of tropical climate. However, it is also grown successfully 
        in humid to sub-humid regions under subtropical and temperate climate. 
        Rice is cultivated in almost all types of soils with varying productivity. 
        Under high temperature, high humidity with sufficient rainfall and irrigation 
        facilities, rice can be grown in any type of soil.</p2></br>

    <p1 class="fonts"><b>C</b>otton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll,
         or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants 
         of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family Malvaceae. 
         The fiber is almost pure cellulose, and can contain minor
          percentages of waxes, fats, pectins, and water.</p1>
          <h3>Climate and Soil requirement of Cotton Crop Cultivations</h3>
          <p2 class="fonts">Cotton  is a tropical plant grown as an annual 
            agricultural crop in hotter regions of the world, 
            including in 17 U.S. states across the South, 
            according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
            Economic Research Service. Cotton requires soil temperatures 
            above 60 degrees Fahrenheit and a long growing season of five
             to six months for a good harvest.</p2></br>
    <h1 class="h-center">Sugarcane</h1>
    <img src="sugarcane.jpeg" alt="sugarcane" class="center">
    <p1 class="fonts"><b1>S</b1>ugarcane, (Saccharum officinarum), perennial grass of the family Poaceae,
         primarily cultivated for its juice from which sugar is processed. Most of 
         the world’s sugarcane is grown in subtropical and tropical areas. The plant 
         is also grown for biofuel production, especially in Brazil, as the canes can 
         be used directly to produce ethyl alcohol (ethanol). The by-products from cane 
         sugar processing, namely the straw and bagasse (cane fibres), can be used to 
         produce cellulosic ethanol, a second-generation biofuel.</p1>
         <h3>Climate and Soil requirement of Sugar cane Crop Cultivations</h3>
    <p2 class="fonts">Sugarcane is an important industrial crop used for sugar and bioenergy.
         It is one of the world’s major C4 crops that mainly grow in the tropic 
         and subtropic regions. Weather and climate related events (i.e., growth 
         environment of atmospheric [CO2], temperature, precipitation, and other 
         extreme weather) are the key factors for sugarcane production worldwide, 
         especially in many developing countries.High temperature due to climate 
         change in Northeastern Brazil will increase the evapotranspiration rates 
         reducing the amount of water available in soils, making the planting of 
         sugarcane increasingly difficult and considerably increasing irrigation 
         demand.</p2></br>

         <h1 class="h-center">Wheat</h1>
        <img src="wheat.jpeg" alt="wheat" class="center">
        <p1 class="fonts"><b1>B</b1>heat is one of the oldest and most important of the cereal crops.
             Of the thousands of varieties known, the most important are common wheat 
             (Triticum aestivum), used to make bread; durum wheat (T. durum), used in 
             making pasta (alimentary pastes) such as spaghetti and macaroni; and club 
             wheat</p1>
             <h3>Climate and Soil requirement of Wheat Crop Cultivations</h3>
        <p2 class="fonts">Wheat is crop of cool environment. However, it requires different temperatures
             at different stages of plant growth and development. Temperature requirement 
             may slightly differ from one variety to another at the time of germination, 
             however, general minimum  temperature  is required from 3.5-5.50 c and  
             optimum 20-250 and maximum temperature is 350 . On temperature below or 
             above to optimum, germination of seed decreases slowly. If temperature 
             is more than 300 c at the time of maturity it leads to force maturity 
             and yield loss. Winter wheat bears cold waves and frost in a better way 
             in comparison to spring wheat.</p2></br>

         <p1 class="fonts"><b>G</b>roundnuts are a popular source of food throughout the world, 
            consumed either as peanut butter or crushed and used for groundnut oil 
            or simply consumed as a confectionary snack. Groundnuts are cultivated 
            in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world on sandy soils. 
            Yields of groundnut vary from about 400 kg to several tonnes per hectare, 
            depending on the production system, but on the average, the global yield 
            is 2500–2700 kg per hectare [30]. Details on soil requirements, required 
            precipitation and temperature, planting season, maturity duration, major 
            diseases, and pests affecting groundnuts</p1>
            <h3>Climate and Soil requirement of ground nut Crop Cultivations</h3>
            <p2 class="fonts">Groundnut is a tropical plant that requires a long, warm growing season.
                 It can grow up to an elevation of 1160 m above sea level. A well-distributed 
                 rainfall of at least 50 cm during growing season, abundant sunshine and relatively 
                 warm temperatures are best suited for its cultivation.</p2></br>
